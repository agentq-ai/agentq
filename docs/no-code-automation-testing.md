- Test cases already created (either manually or through AI)

## Steps

### 1. Start No Code Automation
Begin by clicking the "Automation" or "No Code by AgentQ" button in the interface.

### 5. Configure Test Steps
In the edit view, add prompts or interactions that define how the test should be executed. This is where you specify the actions that should be performed during the test.

### 8. View Results
After completion, you can view the test results:
- Check the test status (Pass/Fail)
- Review video evidence of the test execution

## Tips
- Start with simple test cases when learning the no-code automation feature
- Be specific and clear when defining interactions
- Review the generated video evidence to understand test execution
- Use descriptive names for your test cases and interactions
- Make sure all necessary test data is prepared before running automation
- Regularly review and update your automated tests to maintain reliability

## Best Practices
1. **Test Planning**
   - Plan your test scenarios thoroughly before automation
   - Identify critical paths that need frequent testing
   - Consider edge cases and error scenarios

2. **Interaction Design**
   - Keep interactions simple and focused
   - Use clear, descriptive commands
   - Verify each step works before adding the next

3. **Maintenance**
   - Regularly review and update automated tests
   - Document any special conditions or requirements
   - Keep track of successful and failed executions
