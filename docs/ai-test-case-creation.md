# AI Test Case Creation

Learn how to create test cases automatically using AI in AgentQ.

## Prerequisites
- AgentQ account
- Product Requirements Document (PRD) or similar documentation

## Process Overview
The AI test case creation process consists of four main states:
1. **Data Preparation** - Preparing and uploading your requirements document
2. **Data Processing** - AI analysis of your requirements
3. **Reviewing Test Cases** - Evaluating and adjusting generated test cases
4. **Completion** - Finalizing and saving your test cases

## Detailed Steps

### Data Preparation State
1. Click the "Generate with AI" button to start creating test cases

### Data Processing State
1. Reading PRD
   The system reads and understands your PRD to generate relevant test cases

### Reviewing Test Cases State
Review the generated test cases and choose to:
- Generate more test cases if needed
- Make adjustments to existing test cases
- Complete the review when satisfied

### Completion State
Once you're satisfied with the test cases and complete the review, you'll see a success message confirming that your test cases have been created.
